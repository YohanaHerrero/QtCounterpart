To run the GUI, you need to have the following directories in your work directory:

Folder1 named HST_images (it contains HST images, a maximum of four will be displayed):
             acs_435w_candels-cdfs-01_cut_v2.0.fits
             acs_606w_candels-cdfs-01_cut_v2.0.fits
             acs_814w_candels-cdfs-01_cut.fits
             wfc3_160w_candels-cdfs-01_cut_v2.0.fits
             
Folder2 named Fields (contains MUSE data cube and spectroscopic catalog):
             DATACUBE_candels-cdfs-01_v2.0_dcsub_effnoised.fits
             lsdcat_candels-cdfs-01.fits
             
Directly in your directory, you need the photometric catalog:
             catalog_photometry_candels-cdfs-01.fits 

The HST images must contain a proper WCS with pixel information, i.e. 'CRPIX' keyword. Also, if one wants to perform forced photometry for an 
object, the HST header also needs to contain the keyword 'PHOTFLAM'.

The datacube must have two spatial dimensions, one wavelength dimension and a proper WCS. Besides, the header must contain 
pixel information (keyword 'CD2_2' or 'CDELT2'), 'CD3_3' (bin size of wavelenth), and 'CRVAL3' (starting point of wavelength).

The spectroscopic and photometric catalog must, at least, contain RA, DEC info.
